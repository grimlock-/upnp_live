Gerbera/MT defaults
audio buffer size: 1MB/1,048,576
audio chunk size: 131KB/131,072
audio fill size: 262KB/262,144


video buffer size: 14MB/14,400,000
video chunk size: 512KB/512,000
video fill size: 120KB/120,000


MPC-HC request size: 1MB/1,048,576
VLC request size: 1MB/1,048,576


Streamlink default: 16MB


TeamSp00ky stream (of any significant duration) is ~8000 kb/s (so 8 mb/s aka 1 MB/s) for vid and 128 kb/s for audio
Copying 1 second (1.32 seconds technically) gives ~12000 kb/s (so 12 mb/s aka ~1.5MB/s) for vid and 130 kb/s for audio
That 1 second file's size is just barely under 2MB, which seems to match up with the numbers above
as such, a 30s buffer for a sp00ky stream = ~31MB, meaning gerbera/MT has around a 15 second buffer for transcoding
for audio, 1MB will hold a bit over a minute of 128kb CBR lossy audio and between 7 and 16 seconds of flac (bitrates from 1200kbps to 500kbps)

My ultimate conclusion is to have the dir_delete event created by IN_DELETE and IN_MOVED_FROM messages but
to only remove the watch ID from the hash table with the DELETE/MOVE_SELF messages. The end result is that
queueing the DM event in the vector and removing the watch path from the hash table get done in different
orders depending on event. This may lead to problems later on, so try and come up with a better design

delete directory:
  DELETE_SELF
  IGNORED
  DELETE in housing dir

create & delete directory (scripted):
  CREATE, but making watch fails
  DELETE in housing dir

rename directory:
  MOVED_FROM (old filename)
  MOVED_TO (new filename)
  MOVE_SELF

move directory outside of any watched ones:
  MOVED_FROM
  MOVE_SELF
  create file in moved directory:
    CREATE (path via watch ID is INVALID)
